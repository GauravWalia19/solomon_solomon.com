## WHY THIS PROJECT

Nowdays children have to buy newer books in every new class as old books are not shared with the children of previous class. The children sold their books to garbage collectors or throw away books in the garbage which is a problem of concern for us.

## SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM

To solve this problem we are creating a digital library for students from which children will share books with others children from distance. In this way we can help needy children for the books.
